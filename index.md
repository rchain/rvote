## Register to Vote

A "*Notice of Annual Meeting*" has been emailed to members with instructions on registering a REV address with the Co-op. Registration ends after midnight (PDT) on October 20.

If you don't already have a REV Address, the extended RChain community has developed several wallets capable of generating REV addresses. They are not maintained by the Co-op.

- **Tomislav's [RChain Client](https://tgrospic.github.io/rnode-client-js/)** is Open Source, does not collect user information, and makes up much of the code underlying the RVote application being used to run this years election.
- [Myrchain Wallet](https://myrchainwallet.com/) (Open-source)
- [Rui 安全 Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rui%E9%94%90/jkjnjhfcoeoogcdmdhmckfchlbecholg) extension for Chrome (Open-source)
- [icapo 移动端钱包](https://icapo.app/) Wallet for mobile

Alternatively, you may create a REV Address from an ETH Address:
REV addresses can be derived from any Ethereum address. This means that you can use your favorite ETH wallet to generate an address, and then convert that ETH address to a REV address using one of the tools above. Your Ethereum Private-Key will unlock both the ETH address as well as the REV address.

## [Vote Online](https://vote.rchain.coop)

This year's election utilizes the [RChain Platform](https://developer.rchain.coop), [RVote](https://github.com/rchain-community/rv2020), and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). There will be no in-person or mail-in voting. The online election will go live on Wednesday October 21, and voting will stay open until midnight (PDT) on October 23.

<img src="https://github.com/rchain/www.rchain.coop/raw/master/assets/leadership/rao-b.jpg" width="300"> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vraobhamidipati/)

I am Rao Bhamidipati. I have been involved with RChain since the 2018 Governance conference in Seattle. Starting in July 2019, I engaged deeply with Rchain in turning the project around, delivering the platform technology and several other strategic initiatives, including:

- Sustained the technical development momentum with developers from the community when the funds ran out and the previous developer team left en masse.
- Successfully delivered the mainnet in February 2020 in spite of challenging circumstances and continue to manage the technology delivery program with improved features and quality. I do the technical update part of the community debriefs on Wednesdays.
- Contributed as a member of the Governance committee for nearly two years (including helping with the 2019 elections processes and technology) and have been chairing it since July 2020
- Initiated a Tech Governance committee to manage the techno-economic governance of the platform. In collaboration with community members, come up with appropriate processes and decision mechanisms to govern the growth and security of the Rchain network for all stakeholders
- Contributed to the strategy and business plan for RSaas special purpose vehicle (SPV)
- Currently working intensely on building the developer ecosystem including a hackathon scheduled for Nov 7-8, 2020

Prior to RChain, I had nearly thirty years of experience in the IT and management consulting field. In addition to nine years at Xerox in confidential level management positions with global business exposure, I also worked with many Fortune 100 companies in business and technology roles. I have experience with intrapreneurship in large companies as well as starting and leading startups from scratch. 

I had multiple board experiences over the years, including as a Xerox appointee to the board of the Minority Business Development Corporation (Rochester, NY), with the Association for Image and Information Management (Ohio chapter), and the Healthcare Financial Management Association HFMA (Central Indiana chapter). 

I have a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, Masters in Business Administration (merit scholarship) and a Masters in Computer Science (with full fellowship). Additionally, I participated in industry training such as the Xerox Product Development Management program and kept uptodate with industry skills and certifications, such as passing the Certified Treasury Professional exam, getting certified with the Healthcare Financial Management Association etc. 

I hope you will elect me to the Rchain board. With your support, I would like to bring my skills in technology, business strategy, finance and operations to stabilize Rchain and enhance our market position such that we are the best and most respected platform and organization in the blockchain/ digital ledger space and beyond.

## CAMILA REMALEY

<img src="https://github.com/rchain/www.rchain.coop/raw/master/assets/leadership/camila-remaley.jpg" width="300">

My name is Camila Remaley, I have been a member of RChain since 2018, and I was born and raised in Chile.  I am currently employed by New Venture Fund as the Operations Manager for TheDream.US, which is the nation's largest college access and success program for immigrant youth.  I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting, with a minor in Business Administration at Trinity W. University, graduating Magna Cum Laude.  I continued my education at Fitchburg State University, where I received my Master’s degree with a concentration in Management.  I am an experienced professional and I have worked at large financial firms as an accountant and as a financial associate providing counsel to clients, regarding securities and financial decisions.  During that time, I got registered with the SEC and acquired the series 6 and 63. (SS)

I have over 10 years of experience, which includes banking, accounting, financial operations, and relationship management.  I can provide RChain with the financial and operational experience that my career has given me.  My diverse background and passion for innovative and ground-breaking ideas can offer a distinct perspective to the board.

I would like the opportunity to step forward and represent other women in a market highly dominated by men, by providing my skills and academic background as the first woman on the Board of Directors of RChain.  My sole purpose as a board member would be to look out for the co-op’s (and members') best interest, and like many other members, I want to be part of RChain’s success.

## KANE LUO
<img src="https://github.com/rchain/www.rchain.coop/raw/master/assets/leadership/kane-luo.jpg" width="300"> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kane-luo-a9693541)

I’m Kane Luo, a specialist of sales and marketing with 10 years experience. I worked for an No.1 company in industry and led the regional business revenue to grow from $3 million to $75 million within 5 years. I’m founder of Eomvision, an AI technology company provides vision solutions for Internet of Things. 

I knew Rchain since 2017 and kept tracking the progress what Rchain made. As of the technology achievement made recently, I believe it’s supposed to be the right timing for Rchain to stand out, get market and people to re-cognition the technologies, and the value Rchain offers. I’m a very strong believer on Rchain technology and great vision, in the meanwhile, I also believe we need enhance marketing now to let more people know more about Rchain. 

With my successful sales and marketing experience, I will be firstly focusing on China market which potentially is the biggest market, and structurally rebuilding brand awareness including but not limited on AMAs/roadshows/meetups/medias/and so on. Based on Rchain’s unique technology advantages, we need differentiate ourselves from other public chains to have right marketing positioning. 

I will also focus on business development. Making an analysis in current market to decide which vertical market could be entry point for Rchain, Gaming/DeFi/CDN/Music/NFT/or others? Once this is clear, create incentives in different ways to attract accordingly Dapp developers to build. Making the first excellent Dapp reference with wide users will be my top task. 

I hope you will vote me to be board director to serve in Rchain Cooperative. I look forward to bringing such great technology to people. Thank you!
